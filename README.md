# Introduction

AppMod is a research project on safety and privacy of smart-city mobile applications through model inference done in collaboration between Singapore Management University and Tel-Aviv University. The project designs a system that detects anomalous and potentially harmful behaviours in apps and create suitable alerts. By creating a model that captures the characteristics of an app’s normal behaviour, it can help to detect violations during runtime, summarise the risk in an informative manner, and give users the opportunity to disallow or approve detected anomalies. The project also develops a user interaction model to let more vulnerable members of the community better make security decisions with the help of their trusted more security-savvy relatives/friends, and the crowd. Associate Professors David Lo and Gao Debin from SMU School of Information Systems, as well as senior lecturers Dr Shahar Maoz, Dr Eran Toch, and Dr Eran Tromer from Tel Aviv University are Principal Investigators (PIs and co-PIs) of this project. We gratefully acknowledge the funding provided by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore and the Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center (ICRC), Tel-Aviv University, Israel.
